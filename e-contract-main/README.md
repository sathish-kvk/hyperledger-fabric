# E-Contract Blockchain Application

A Hyperledger Fabric-based blockchain application for managing electronic contracts with a complete UI and API layer.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This application consists of:
- **Blockchain Network**: Hyperledger Fabric with Certificate Authority, Orderers, and Peers
- **Smart Contracts (Chaincode)**: Business logic deployed on the blockchain
- **API Layer**: Node.js REST API for blockchain interaction
- **UI Layer**: Web-based user interface

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Latest version
- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
- **npm**: Latest version
- **Linux/Unix environment** (tested on Ubuntu)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Bring up Certificate Authority (CA)

    cd e-contract-main/blockchain/artifacts/channel/reate-certificate-with-ca
    sudo docker-compose up -d

    This will start the CA containers required for certificate Generation.

### 2. Generate Certificates

    ./create-certificate-with-ca.sh

    This creates cryptographic materials in e-contract-main/blockchain/artifacts/channel/crypto-config

### 3. Create Channel Artifacts

    cd e-contract-main/blockchain/artifacts/channel
    ./create-artifacts.sh

    This generates the genesis block in e-contract-main/blockchain/channel-artifacts
    
### 4. Start Orderers and Peers

    cd e-contract-main/blockchain/artifacts
    sudo docker-compose up -d

    This will start 7 containers (orderers and peer nodes).

### 5. Create and Join Channel
    
    cd e-contract-main/blockchain/scripts
    ./createChannel.sh

Expected Output:
    Using organization 1
    Status: 201
    {
    "name": "mychannel",
    "url": "/participation/v1/channels/mychannel",
    "consensusRelation": "consenter",
    "status": "active",
    "height": 1
    }
    ...
    Successfully submitted proposal to join channel

### 6. Deploy Chaincode
    cd e-contract-main/blockchain/scripts
    ./deployChaincode.sh
